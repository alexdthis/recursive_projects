#Take a list as an array
#Divide the list into two arrays
#Keep doing it until you have individual items in their own arrays
#Take two arrays, read the first element of each.
#Append the smaller of the two into a larger array, then the larger
#Repeat the second element and so on.
#Return the sorted array
